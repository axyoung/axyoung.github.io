## Alex Young Portfolio

This is my portfolio that shares my journey through Computer Science over the years. As I progress in my education and encounter new opporunities in computer science I will update this portfolio.

Currently I am a 2nd Year Masters student studying Computer Science at UC Davis.
My previous work can be mostly found on my github - [github.com/axyoung](https://github.com/axyoung).

The links attached to the following headers will lead to more in-depth detail on my experiences.

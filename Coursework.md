## Web Development

I took this class as an ecampus course in Spring 2019 which was a new experience for me.
Despite this, I learned quite a lot about building websites, including how the client and server interact, as well as how tools like http and js work.
As my final project during this course I designed and built a webpage/blog to share information about webnovels I enjoyed.

## Discrete Math

This was another course I took in Spring 2019. In this course I learned about logic, set theory, recursion and induction, spanning trees, and direct proof techniques.
While some of the tools I learned in the course are not entirely applicable to my other courses, much of the information such as logic and recursion became the building blocks for tools I used in other courses.

## Operating Systems I and II

I took OS1 in Winter 2021 and OS2 in Fall 2021.
In these two course I learned about how modern operating systems work and even ended up building an operating system myself.
These two courses were some of the most intensive out of all computer science courses at OSU.

In Operating Systems I there was a focus on communicating using system calls, processes and threads.
The main project I completed during this course was developing my own smallsh - a shell in C.

In Operating Systems II there was a focus on the hardware/software stack.
Throughout the course labs I built up a jos operating system by hand.

## Software Engineering I and II

I took SE 1 in Fall 2021 and SE 2 in Winter 2022.
In these two courses I learned about the software development cycle.
This includes going over concepts such as requirements, designing, modeling, and testing.


## Computer Networks

I took Intro to Computer Networks in Spring 2021.
In this course I studied the basics of Computer Networks. We covered a lot of material ranging from packet switching, to analyzing network protocols and network security.

## Intro to AI

I took Intro to Artificial Intelligence in Spring 2021.
This course taught me basic concepts relating to AI. Specifically I completed project related to gent architectures, search, games, logic and reasoning, and Bayesian networks.

## Assembly Language

I took Computer Organization and Assembly Language in Winter 2021.
In this course I learned about the underlying building blocks of a computer. I studied the AVR architecture and learned to program in Assembly language.
In addition, I gained an intricate understanding of the inner workings of an embedded processor.

## Theory of Computation

I took Intro to Theory of Computation in Fall 2021.
In this course I learned about various types of automata, grammars and langauges. 

## Social and Ethical Issues in CS

I took Soc & Ethical Issues In Comsc in Spring 2021.
This course taught me how to critically evaluate issues involving science and technology in order to make ehtically sound decisions.

## Computer Architecture

I took Computer Architecture in Fall 2021.
In this course I learned about the design philosphies of involved in computer architectures involving processors, memory, I/O and more.
I also learned about how pipelining and memory organization works.

## Advanced Web Development
I took Advanced Web Development in Winter 2022.
In this course I learned about modern web development concepts and techniques. This included using tools like react app and nextjs for constructing user interfaces and for server-side processing. Throughout this course I worked through multiple projects where I developed simple web applications.

## Mobile Development
I took Mobile Development in Winter 2022.
In this course I was introduced to techniques and concepts related to developing mobile applications. Thoguhtout this course I worked on multiple projects through Android Studios where I developed simple mobile applications.

## Translators
I took Translators in Spring 2022.
Throughout this course I was introduced to the workings of compilers. This included attribute grammars, syntax-directed translation, lex, yacc, LR(1) parsers, symbol tables, semantic analysis and peep-hole optimization.

## Cloud Development
I took Cloud Dev in Spring 2022.
In this course I was introduced to concepts and techniques for developing and deploying RESTful cloud APIs. I also learned how to use docker and docker-compose.

## Parallel Programming
I took Parallel Programming in Spring 2022.
In this course we covered a wide variety of concepts, including: Moore's Law and Multicore, Multicore programming using OpenMP, Speedups and Amdahl's Law, Hyperthreading, Caching issues and False Sharing, Data Decomposition, Functional Decomposition, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), GPU Computing, including CUDA and OpenCL, OpenCL / OpenGL Interoperability, and finally Message Passing Interface (MPI).

## Capstone Project

The capstone project is a three term course that I took over my Senior year at OSU.
In the Capstone project I worked with a team of 5 and Intel DevCloud on the project: Artificial Intelligence in Intel DevCloud.
In this project we focused on implementing a Deepfake Detection solution into Intel DevCloud and creating a front-end web-app that interacted with the AI in Intel DevCloud.

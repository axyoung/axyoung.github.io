## Coursework

While taking the masters program at UC Davis I have taken the following graduate level courses:

 - ECS 271 - MACHINE LEARNING AND DISCOVERY
 - ECS 293A - RESEARCH IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
 - ECS 390 - TEACHING COMPUTER SCIENCE
 - ECS 201A - COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
 - ECS 240 - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
 - ECS 222A - DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
 - ECS 289G - SPECIAL TOPICS: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - ADVANCED DEEP LEARNING
 - ECS 235A - COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SECURITY
 - ECS 256 - PROBABILITY MOODELS
 - ECS 289L - SPECIAL TOPICS - DEEP LEARNING - audited
 - ECS 289G - SPEICAL TOPICS - COMPUTATIONAL STORYTELLING - audited

## MACHINE LEARNING

This course was my first time diving deep into machine learning. In this course I learned hands-on about various machine learning models and how they work.
In addition, I learned how to apply these models to real life data in appropriate ways.

In this class I completed a project where my group used a variety of classifiers to run try to build a sentiment analysis model.
The goal of this model was to determine if some set of text was positive or negative. For our data sets we used a set of labeled tweeets, movie reviews, and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.
Feel free to contact me if you want to learn more about the work my group did in this project.

## COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

This upper division computer architecture course covered the history of computer architecure then dived into processor architecture, memory system architecture, and finally parallel architecture.
I quite enjoyed learning about spectre and meltdown as well as the implications of how the end of Dennard scaling will impact the future of optimization.

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

I found this course to be quite interesting and a change of pace from other computer science courses I had recently taken.
In this graduate level programming langauges course we looked into how to verify correctnes of programs and static program analysis.
To elaborate, I learned that extracting properties of programs is approximating their semantics.

## ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS

In this course we went over the design and analysis of algorithms at a graduate level.

## ADVANCED DEEP LEARNING

This course was a research and project centric course where I learned a lot about the current state of artificial intelligence.
Students of the course read through many new papers related to deep learning and presented their findings to the class.
I also got the chance to engage with machine learning through a long project in which my group looked at tokenizing audio for transformer models.

## PROBABILITY MODELS

Basic Probability and Statistics.  Markov models. Sampling, estimation and model building. Regression analysis. Queueing models. Bayesian estimation. Applications to data mining, networks, disk systems, security, software engineering and bioinformatics.

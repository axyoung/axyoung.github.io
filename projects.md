## Portfolio Projects

Over the course of my four years at Oregon State University I completed many large projects in the processes of getting my Computer Science degree.

I will share a few of these projects here. Much of the code for the work I have done on these projects is privated on my github. Feel free to contact me if access is needed.


## Computing Second and Third Minimum Spanning Trees

This [first project](https://github.com/axyoung/Analysis-of-Algorithms/tree/main/GA4) I will share is one I completed during my Analysis of Algorithms course that I took in Fall 2020.

In this project I designed and coded an algorithm in python to compute the second and third minimum spanning trees.
Despite this being a group project, I did my share in both understanding the algorithm and coding.

The main algorithm that I based my own python code off of was Kruskal's Algorithm, however I had to make certain optimizations for edge cases.

I feel like this project exemplifies some of my skills in working with a team and my understanding of algorithms and python.

## Spaceflight Mathematics

In this project I used an ATmega128 board to solve math equations related to spaceflight. These are similar equations to those solved by the CPU that drove the Apollo 11 mission.

In order to program the ATmega 128 board I used AVR assembly code to solve these various math equations.
More details can be found in the hyperlinks to my [report](https://github.com/axyoung/Assembly/blob/main/Final/Final/ece375-final.pdf) and my [code](https://github.com/axyoung/Assembly/blob/main/Final/Final/ece375_final.asm).

This project was a good way for me to show what I learned about assembly language.

## Hack The Box and Spectre

In my Defense Against the Dark Arts course that I took over the summer of 2021, I completed a large variety of projects, ranging from actually using a stack overflow exploit to hack into a VM to analyzing malware and finding messages in SDRs.

To keep this section shorter, I will share my work that I did for my final in DADA. In one part I researched and prepared a presentation on the Spectre vulnerability, which is named as such due to the way if lingers in modern microprocessors.
This presentation can be found [here](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/s/oy9dd5ovb6hrbgzewjpyu8ps5a0xm37z).

Other than this, I also participated in three Hack The Box challenges. I found these challenges quite fun and interesting so I thought I should share the problem solving I did for them [here](https://github.com/axyoung/Defense-Against-Dark-Arts/blob/main/Final%20Project.pdf) as well.

## Intro to AI

Throughout my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course I completed three large programming assignments. Each of these projects tested different skills that I had related to AI and algorithms.

I quite enjoyed completing these projects. In the first project I used search algorithms to solve the classic chicken and wolves problem as well as analyze search algorithms.

In the second project I created a program to play simplified Othello, a solvable classic board game. In this project I used the minimax algorithm to program the computer opponent.

Finally in the third project I used Sentiment Analysis to determine if a text is positive or negative. This sort of langauge processing and analysis is quite useful to know about.

A compilation of these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/axyoung/Intro-to-AI).

## Reliable Data Transmission implementation

I completed this project as part of Intro to Computer Networks. In this project the goal was to implement a higher level RDT layer.
This RDT layer would deliver data from client to server without any errors, even when running through an unreliable channel.

My code and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/axyoung/Intro-to-Networks/tree/main/Project%202).

Overall, this project shows my understanding of network protocols and how I can use python to simulate them.

## smallsh

The smallsh project was the most difficult and longest project I had ever completed. In this project I build a basic shell from scratch in C.
This shell could excecute the in-built commands 'exit', 'cd', and 'status', as well as other commands using 'exec'. In addtion this shell could handle foreground and background process and signals.

The code and comments for this smallsh can be found [here](https://github.com/axyoung/Operating-Systems/tree/main/A3). 

Smallsh was a portfolio roject done for the Operating Systems course. In this course I also completed other interesting projects such as a Multi-threaded Producer Consumer Pipeline.

I feel like this project demonstates my knowledge of how files, process, and C works.

## AI for Good in Education

In my Social and Ethical Issues in CompSci course I did not do any coding that I can share here. However, I did a lot of reading and research into ethics and how they pertain to Computer Science. I feel like this topic is very important in todays world and felt like it would be fitting to present an essay I wrote for this course as part of my portfolio.

In this [essay](https://github.com/axyoung/Ethics-in-CS/blob/main/Social%20Contract%20Theory_%20AI%20for%20Good%20in%20Education.pdf) I discuss how artificial intelligence can be used for good in the field of education. In addition, I analyze the use of AI in education from the point of view of Social Contract Theory.

## Modeling Lightning through an L-System

In this project I modeled 3D lightning bolt patterns using an l-system and recursion. I use OpenGL and C as tools to program this visualization of lightning. While my lightning bolts are not entirely realistic, learning about and implementing this project was very fun. Documentation explaining this project is located [here](https://github.com/axyoung/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/CG%20Final%20Project.pdf).

## Intel Devcloud with Artificial Intelligence

Intel DevCloud with Artificial Intelligence is my OSU capstone project. I worked on this project with a team of 5 other students over the course of three terms. Here is a quick summary of what our team worked on:

This is an open-ended project where our team has to search for an appropriate application of Artificial Intelligence to further research and develop training and inference models with Intel Devcloudâ€™s built-in tools. The overall idea behind our project is testing the viability of students using cloud tools like the Intel DevCloud for artificial intelligence and machine learning projects. Our group has chosen a deepfake detection challenge as our starting point for our project. With this challenge, the long-term goal will be to create inference models that can detect whether or not a video is a deepfake using two different algorithms. We will then be able to compare the two algorithms and see which one is more effective.

In addition to working with Artificial Intelligence in Intel DevCloud, a large portion of the project was to create an interactive web-app that could connect to and fetch Deepfake Detection Results from Intel DevCloud in real time. This web-app was presented and shared during OSU's engineering expo.

Our groups final git repo includes instructions for testing out our project yourself, as well as ideas for future improvement: [https://github.com/OSU-AI-with-Intel-DevCloud](https://github.com/OSU-AI-with-Intel-DevCloud).

## Advanced-Web Development Final - Muvi

In this group project I worked on developing a web-app that uses the TMDB api to display lists of movies and their details. You can also log into tmdb from the app in order to set favorite movies and a watchlist. [https://github.com/osu-cs499-w22/muvi](https://github.com/osu-cs499-w22/muvi)

## Mobile Development Final - Game Collection

In this group project I worked on developing a mobile-app that uses the RAWG api to display lists of games and their details. You can also use the app's database to set favorite games. [https://github.com/osu-cs492-w22/game-collection](https://github.com/osu-cs492-w22/game-collection)

## Cloud-Application Development Final - Tarpaulin API

In this group project I worked on developing an api for the Tarpaulin application. Tarpaulin is a lightweight course management tool. This RESTful API allows users to store and see information about different courses and assignments.

## Tokenizing audio: Pipelining TokenLearner Models

In this group project for Advanced Deep Learning my group dived into TokenLearner and transformer models. Here is our [Paper](https://github.com/axyoung/axyoung.github.io/blob/main/files/Tokenizing_audio_paper.pdf).

## Social Biases in Large Language Models

My research under Setareh Rafatirad has had me conduct large scale research on social biases or stereotypes in popular large language models such as ChatGPT and BERT. In our investigation we used stereotype benchmark datasets and applied them to LLMs. We analyzed the outputs and what they could mean, then looked to find ways to improve and fine-tune the machine learning models to see what sort of effective ways there are to better detect and avoid bias. Part of the novelty of our approach includes our direction using MCQA - multiple choice questioning - prompt techniques and our investigation into how this training can be more generalized.

While we are working on publishing a paper related to our work, this is still underway. Linked [here](https://github.com/axyoung/axyoung.github.io/blob/main/files/GPT_Stereotyping_Project_Report.pdf) is a copy of a report I did covering my role in the project.
